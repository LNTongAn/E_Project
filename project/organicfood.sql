Superfoods are packed with nutrients and can provide your body with the vitamins and minerals you need to maintain, grow and feel healthier.\r\n<br>
<br>\r\nHowever, the term superfood is not commonly used by nutritionists and nutrition scientists\r\n<br>

<br>\r\n\r\nIf you remove all the traditional chocolate bars from the sugar and animal products like butter or milk, you\'ll be left with only one ingredient that\'s really good for you: CACAO<br>
<br>\r\n\r\nBut what is cocoa and where does it come from? Is cocoa really good for health? And what is the best way to eat cocoa?<br>
<br>\r\n\r\nCacao comes from the Theobroma cacao tree, which in Greek means \"food of the gods\". The Aztecs really believed that cocoa was a gift from the gods.<br>
<br>\r\n\r\nCocoa consumption can be traced back 4,000 years to the Maya, Toltec and Aztec civilizations. The Aztecs not only used cocoa beans as currency, but also as a drink for the rich and elite. <br>

<br>\r\n\r\nCocoa powder is one of the richest sources of polyphenols. It is especially high in flavanols, which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. They all have positive health effects, like better blood circulation, lower blood pressure, and improved cholesterol and blood sugar levels<br>
<br>\r\n\r\nDark Chocolate<br><br>\r\n\r\nDark chocolate is rich in minerals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. The cocoa in dark chocolate also contains antioxidants called flavonoids, which may offer a number of health benefits.<br>
<br>\r\n\r\nDark chocolate is like a lot of chocolate available in the market in bar form. But the point here is to choose quality dark chocolate with 70% or higher cocoa content.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCocoa has captivated the world for thousands of years and is an important part of modern cuisine in the form of chocolate. Remember that chocolate still contains significant amounts of sugar and fat, so if you\'re going to use it, stick to it in moderation and combine it with a healthy balanced diet.<br>< br>', 'blog3.jpg', '2022-07-14'),

Usage: Cabbage is usually prepared by boiling, or stir-frying, making salads, rolling meat or making salads. (For recipes refer to the delicacies section) How to store: When you buy it but haven\'t used it, don\'t wash it because it will spoil quickly when it gets wet, put it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge (for about approx. 1 week).
